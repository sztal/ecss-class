    "The notebook at the end of the day is just a list of cells (chunks) with either text or executable code and its output. To enter the input mode and type in code or text into a cell you need to simply click on the cell. However, you do not need to use the mouse. There are quite a few extremely useful shortcuts that allow navigating through the document using almost only the keyboard (you will learn fast that it is what you want to do most of the time). \n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to remember that there are two modes: `input` and `navigate` mode. While the former is quite obvious because it is used to type, the latter allows moving between cells. In the navigate mode, you can move between cells using arrow keys. To enter the input mode press `enter`, and you will be able to type in something. On the other hand, you can leave the input mode without executing the cell by simply pressing `esc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before entering the cell it is good to know what you will write inside, whether it will be code or text. Therefore, press `m` to write plain text and `y` to write the code (obviously you need to be in the navigate mode otherwise you will just type either m or r). However, the default input is code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute the cell press `shift + enter` or `ctrl + enter`. The difference between these two shortcuts is subtle. The former executes the code and moves to the next cell in the navigate mode, and the latter executes the code while staying in the same cell in the navigate mode. Bellow, there are a few useful tips on how to use Jupyter Notebook effectively:\n",
    "- use arrows `up` and `down` to navigate\n",
    "- use `enter` to enter the input mode\n",
    "- use `esc` to leave the input mode\n",
    "- use `m` when in the navigate mode to change the cell to text cell\n",
    "- use `y` when in the navigate mode to change the cell to code cell\n",
    "- use `a` when in the navigate mode to add a cell above the current cell\n",
    "- use `b` when in the navigate mode to add cell below the current cell\n",
    "- use `c` when in the navigate mode to copy the current cell\n",
    "- use `v` when in the navigate mode to paste the cell below the current cell\n",
    "- press `dd` (double d) when in the navigate mode to delete the current cell"
