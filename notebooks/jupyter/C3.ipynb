    "The notebook in the end of the day is just a list of cells (chunks) with either text or executable code and its output. To enter the input mode and type in code or text into a cell you need to simply click on the cell. However, you do not need to use the mouse. There are quite a few extremly useful shortcats which allow to navigate through the document using almost only keyboard (you will learn fast that it is what you want to do most of the time). \n",

    "First, you need to remember that there are two modes: input and navigate mode. While the former is quite obvious because it is used to type, the latter allows to move between cells. In navigation mode you can move between cells using arrow keys. To enter the input mode press `enter`, and you will be able to type in something. On the other hand you can leave the \n",
