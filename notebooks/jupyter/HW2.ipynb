Once the work is done download the notebook file (`File > Download .ipynb`) rename it properly so it follows a template `HW2_<SURNAME>_<NAME>.ipynb` and send the file to us. Please, for exercise 1 also attach a JSON line file with the scrapped data. Use one (or preferably both) of the following e-mails:\n",

Moreover, you can also visit us in the ISS on the fourth floor (room 415). Usually, at least one of us is there after 11/12 for at least a few hours. Although it is best to set up a meeting earlier via e-mail or a private message."
