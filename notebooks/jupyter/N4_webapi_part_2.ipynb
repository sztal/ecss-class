    "# Web APIs and HTTP requests: part II\n",
    "\n",
    "Brief reminder. Web API (*Application Programming Interface*) is a web-based (often public or semi-public), a programmable interface that allows third parties to communicate with some digital system in an organized and automated manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, the majority of web APIs use the HTTP protocol to communicate with the external world. The HTTP protocol is the standard communication protocol used everywhere around the World Wide Web (this is exactly the protocol that your browser uses to communicate with servers that host websites you use). By this virtue REST API are very universal and flexible as HTTP-based communication is supported by every serious programming language and/or operating system. Moreover, it makes it even possible to use REST APIs via a browser, which is very handy for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in summary, a web API is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Remote.** Users can access the resources from anywhere, provided they have an internet connection.\n",
    "* **Reliable.** The interface exposed to users is stable, which means that it does not change often in time and is largely independent of changes within the system on top of which it sits.\n",
    "* **Programmable.** API can be interacted with based on a predefined set of commands/methods/endpoints (an interface) in a way that can be expressed with a programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, perhaps one of the most important features of a web API is the fact that it is identified by a unique URL and IP number (exactly in the same way as any ordinary website). Every particular method/endpoint in the API can be interacted with by extending the base URL of the API with appropriate query parameters and/or subdirectories. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php is the base URL of the Wikipedia API.\n",
    "* https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=random&rnnamespace=0&rnlimit=2 is the URL that uses the `query` endpoint and the `list` method nested within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us remind ourselves of the anatomy of URL-based communication with web APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base URL `https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php` is a simple, standard URL. Nothing special about except for the fact that it points to the location at which the Wikipedia API lives. Now, note that the `query` action is an extension of the base URL of the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `<BASE_URL> ? <QUERY STRING>`\n",
    "* Where query string is a sequence of key-value pairs of the following form `<key1>=<value1>&<key2>=<value2> ...`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `?` sign separates the base URL from the query string part. And in our example, the query params (key-value pairs) specify that we want the API to use the `query` endpoint and use it to execute the `list=random` method with the following arguments: `rnamespace=0&rnlimit=2`. The `query` endpoint and all its methods such as `list=random` are properly documented at: `https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=help&modules=query` (note that this website is served also through an API query)."

    "```python\n",
    "for page in data['query']['random']:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "page_ids = [ page['id'] for page in data['query']['random'] ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "It does exactly the same as the previous example but in a neater way. The difference is that first you write what is happening in the loop `page['id']` and afterward you define the loop `for page in data['query']['random']`."
