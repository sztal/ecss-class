    "The general idea behind webscraping is quite simple. Instead of copying the website yourself you employ a computer program to do so. You all have already seen the scheme presented below.\n",
    "![Webscraping](png/webscraping.jpg)\n",
    "Although it is that simple you need to remember that the robot (the web spider) does not see the webpage exactly as we do in a web browser, but looks only at the HTML code. We talked a bit about it during the introduction to APIs, but now we will dig into it even more. Let's first click at the link below and see the webpage under it.\n",

Let's now look at what is behind the nicely looking webpage. To see the HTML source code you simply need to press `ctrl + shift + I` (or in Safari on Mac `cmd + option + I`).

The HTML code describes the structure of the webpage and contains multiple elements, which are represented as tags. During the introduction to APIs we talked a bit about tags, but let us now concretize what was said then. So, for the time being, let's move away from WikiLeaks and concentrate on the easy example of a HTML code which creates a simple webpage (if you do not believe us you can just copy the code below and save it in the notepad with extension HTML).\n",

    "Let's now move back to the [Wikileaks](https://wikileaks.org/fishrot/) webpage and open its source code. At first glance, it looks how it should. There are ```<html>```, ```<head>```, and ```<body>``` tags. However, instead of getting straight into paragraphs and titles in the ```<body>``` tag we have some strange ```<div>``` tags. They serve as containers of other HTML elements and as the name suggests divide the HTML document into meaningful sections. If we look at the WikiLeaks webpage there is a bunch of different ```<div>``` tags inside the ```<body>``` tag (there are two other tags there as well, but we will ignore them for time being). In most of the web browser, you can either hover over the tag to highlight the specific part of the webpage or hover over the part of the webpage to highlight the specific container. Either way, you need to know in which container the data you are interested in is stored so you can direct your robot (webspider) to navigate to this specific tag and extract the text from it."

One of the most convenient is to use so-called CSS selectors.

So in r case, the appropriate CSS selector is the following:\n",

Most often we extend selectors by adding information on classes and ids attached to HTML tags.
