    "So having the above code in the Notebook is a cool thing. Most likely it will work next time we want to use it. However, it would be a bit pointless executing the whole code every time we want to analyze the text about Fishrot. So obviously one way of doing it would be printing it first and then copying and pasting it to the desired file. Although it is not the most effective way of doing it, let's think for a moment what this process would look like. What does your friend do when they want to write to a file a text from the Internet? They usually start the following way:\n",

Yes and No. If we write something to our file before closing it then yes we would append it to the end of the file. However, if we close the file and open it again then we would overwrite the information which was there. So are we doomed and we can't append anything to the files? Obviously not.
