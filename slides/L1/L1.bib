abstract = {We show that easily accessible digital records of behavior, Facebook Likes, can be used to automatically and accurately predict a range of highly sensitive personal attributes including: sexual orientation , ethnicity, religious and political views, personality traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive substances, parental separation , age, and gender. The analysis presented is based on a dataset of over 58,000 volunteers who provided their Facebook Likes, detailed demographic profiles, and the results of several psychomet-ric tests. The proposed model uses dimensionality reduction for preprocessing the Likes data, which are then entered into logistic/ linear regression to predict individual psychodemographic profiles from Likes. The model correctly discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual men in 88{\%} of cases, African Americans and Caucasian Americans in 95{\%} of cases, and between Democrat and Republican in 85{\%} of cases. For the personality trait "Openness," prediction accuracy is close to the test-retest accuracy of a standard personality test. We give examples of associations between attributes and Likes and discuss implications for online personalization and privacy. social networks | computational social science | machine learning | big data | data mining | psychological assessment},
