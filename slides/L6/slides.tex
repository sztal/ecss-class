\section{Final project}

\begin{frame}{Possible forms of the project}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{Research project proposal.}
 A short proposal for a research project using some of the methods we discussed in the class. Details are discussed
 in \textit{Structure of the proposal} section.
 \item \textbf{Simple research project and report.}
 Simple data-driven project in which you gather some data from an external web-based source (i.e. from an API or through webscraping), process it and use it to answer a simple research question. Details are discussed in
 \textit{Structure of the project} section.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Structure of the proposal | general information}
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Introduction and problem statement.}
 This section should explain what is the project about in general and why the given problem matters. The significance of the problem may be justified both in terms of its theoretical/scientific or societal/business relevance.
 \item \textbf{Research question.}
 What is the specific research question you will try to answer in the project? It can be either formulated as a strict hypothesis or as an exploratory question (i.e. not assuming any particular effect or mechanism).
 \item \textbf{Research methods.}
 This section should discuss, at a general level, what data do you plan to use and how will analyze it. In particular, you should clearly explain why the data and methods you chose will allow you to answer your research question.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Structure of the proposal | research methods}
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Data collection.} What is the data you are planning to use?
 Where is it stored and how do you plan to obtain/extract it?
 Are there any possible obstacles and if there are what can be done to minimize the risk of failure?
 \item \textbf{Data preprocessing and storage.}
 How will you preprocess data and in what format will store it for later use? For instance, when scraping you may decide to data gathered from
 every individual website to a JSON object and store all data in
 \texttt{.jl} file (JSON lines).
 \item \textbf{Analytic methods.}
 What analytic methods will you apply to your data in order to answer your question? This may include some methods that we discussed in the class
 (i.e. sentiment analysis or some other natural language processing methods),
 but you should also use your general statistical knowledge to decide how you want to model your final data.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Structure of the project}
\begin{itemize}
 \item The project should consist of two main items:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{Notebook} with code and description of the project.
 More on that below.
 \item File with the \textbf{raw data} as was extracted from the external data source (e.g. API or webpage).
 \end{enumerate}
 \item The notebook should include a short introduction describing the problem and why it is significant.
 \item The specific research question should be introduced.
 \item Data source should be discussed. In particular in relation to the research question.
 \item Data analysis methods should be discussed, also in relation to the research question.
 \item Code and text should be mixed in the notebook in a way that facilitates understanding of the adopted research methods and obtained results.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Things to remember}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Make sure you will be able to gather data legally.
 For instance, if you want to scrape some websites you should try to determine whether they allow scraping. You can check this by
 looking at the so-called \texttt{robots.txt} of a website.
 It can be found at \texttt{<url>/robots.txt}. For instance,
 you can see Facebook configuration at \texttt{facebook.com/robots.txt}.
 \item Be kind for your data source. If there is a platform that exposes an API you should use it instead of scraping data directly from its webpage.
 \item Think about proper format for storing data. If you plan to use your data to compute a statistical model in SPSS may be JSON lines are not the best and you should consider storing your data as a simple CSV file?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Formal requirements}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{The project is due to 7.02.2020 23:59:59}
        \item If you decide to submit a project please send us two files: the notebook and the data file. Please, remember to rename them properly FP\_<SURNAME>\_<NAME>.ipynb and FP\_<SURNAME>\_<NAME>.jl (the data file might have the format of your choice).
        \item If you decide to submit a proposal your work should not be shorter than 3 pages and not longer than 5 (interline: single, font size: 12). Please, remember to rename your file properly FP\_<SURNAME>\_<NAME>.docx.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
